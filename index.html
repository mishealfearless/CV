        I am a highly skilled and motivated full-stack web developer with over 1 year of experience in the industry.
        John's passion for coding and problem-solving has driven him to continuously improve his skills and stay up to
        date with the latest technologies.

        John has a strong background in front-end development, using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
        React to create user-friendly and visually appealing websites. He also has extensive experience in back-end
        development, with a deep understanding of server-side technologies such as Node.js, Express, and Python.

        John is an expert in developing and integrating RESTful APIs, ensuring seamless communication between the
        front-end and back-end of web applications. He also has a solid understanding of databases, including MySQL and
        MongoDB, and can efficiently manage the storage and retrieval of data.

        I was responsible for the development and maintenance of several large-scale web applications, working closely
        with a team of designers, developers, and stakeholders to deliver high-quality products on time and within
        budget.

        on my free time, I enjoys contributing to open-source projects and participating in hackathons, where i can
        challenge myself and showcase my skills to the wider developer community.</p>
